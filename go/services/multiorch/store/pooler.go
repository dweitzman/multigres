// Pooler is multiorch's per-pooler cache rider. It bundles the proto
// health state with the per-pooler stream-lifecycle handle.
//
// Concurrency: all access to the proto state is mediated by an internal
// mutex. Readers receive an independent clone via Health(); writers run
// their callback under the lock via Mutate, so a read-modify-write inside
// a single Mutate sees a consistent snapshot (no TOCTOU across the
// callback). Health() callers may safely modify the returned proto since
// it is independent of any future mutation. The HealthStream field is
// set once at OnLive and pointer-stable.
//
// TODO (design cleanup, follow-up PR): PoolerHealthState shouldn't be a
// proto at all — it's never serialized over any RPC (zero references
// in multiorchservice.proto or any other .proto service). The proto
// machinery is overhead with no payoff: schema rigidity, proto.Clone
// cost on every Health()/Mutate(), generated code, etc.
//
// Beyond the proto issue, the type itself amalgamates three unrelated
// concerns:
//
//	(a) a COPY of the etcd Multipooler — already authoritatively held
//	    in the cache's entry.Pooler, so this is needless duplication.
//	(b) the multipooler's reported Status (the actual pooler health
//	    reply, multipoolermanagerdata.Status — itself a real wire type).
//	(c) orch bookkeeping fields (last_check_*, stream_*, etc.) that
//	    grew organically without intent.
//
// Target shape:
//   - entry.Pooler stays the single source of truth for etcd identity.
//   - The rider becomes a small Go struct (not a proto) holding the
//     pooler's *multipoolermanagerdata.Status plus only the orch
//     bookkeeping that has a justified consumer. Every field needs a
//     real reader; if nobody reads it, it doesn't exist.
//   - Helpers (FindPoolerByID, FindPoolersInShard, FindShardMembers)
//     read identity from entry.Pooler and runtime state from the rider.
//
// Don't accrete fields on PoolerHealthState in the meantime — every new
// field makes the cleanup more invasive.
